MyFacebook Connect is meant to be the missing bridge between Facebook and MyBB. The plan is to let users login with their Facebook account, registering if they don't have an account on your board, and linking their Facebook account to their account on your board if they have one already. **At the moment MyFacebook Connect is in early development stages and SHOULDN'T BE USED ON ANY BOARD AT ALL**.

It is based upon Facebook SDK 3.x. It will be free as in freedom.
